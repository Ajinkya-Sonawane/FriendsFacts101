136,Friends was supposed to have just four friends.,Phoebe and Chandler were originally written as supporting roles. Can you even imagine?

139,David Schwimmer didn’t have to audition for Ross.,"As Kauffman explained in 2012, “Schwimmer had auditioned the year before for a pilot we were making, and he just stuck in our heads. That was an offer. No audition.”"
140,Phoebe was supposed to be goth.,"Phoebe was originally pitched as a “goth girl,” which prompted Janeane Garofalo to turn down the role. “There is some truth to it, but not exactly that,” she later explained. “Long ago before Friends was Friends, when it was in its infancy, it was a show called Friends Like Us, and I was being considered for a role, like a goth girl, which I think morphed into Phoebe.”"
141,Gunther was a barista IRL.,"“I had a job at a coffee shop called The Bourgeois Pig in Hollywood, which is still around and one of the last independent coffee shops that hasn’t been taken over or whatnot,"" James Michael Tyler told BuzzFeed in 2014. “I was one of their first baristas—I think I started there in 1990 or so.”"

146,There was an intervention for Jennifer Aniston’s tardiness.,"“David did it. Very kindly,” Aniston later told Us Weekly. “The day my alarm didn’t ring.”"
147,There’s a reason “The One Where No One’s Ready” takes place entirely in Monica’s apartment.,"Showrunners used a “bottle episode” format for this season 3 favorite due to budget restrictions, as it was later revealed in the 2005 special, Friends: Final Thoughts."
148,Lisa Kudrow hated the guitar at first.,"In fact, she suggested that Phoebe play the bongos instead. (Thankfully, the guitar stuck.)"
149,Bruce Willis guest starred on the show after losing a bet.,"The bet was with Matthew Perry, his costar in The Whole Nine Yards (2000). Rumor has it that Bruce donated his money to charity. Either way, he will always be the neatest guy."

153,Phoebe is actually not swearing while playing Ms. Pac-Man.,"“Oh! I don’t know if I was allowed to actually swear,” Lisa Kudrow revealed in a Reddit AMA. “We pre-shot that part, and I think I remember Kevin Bright, our executive producer, laughing and saying, ‘I know, but no one should even be able to read it on your lips.’”"
154,Ross lied about not liking ice cream.,"Before he enjoyed a sweet treat with Elizabeth (“The One Where Ross Dates a Student”), Ross had ice cream with Marcel (“The One After the Superbowl”). Doesn’t look like your teeth are hurting in both cases, Ross."
155,"For a long time, Friends was not allowed to show even a condom wrapper during the 8 p.m. slot.","As cocreator David Crane told Vanity Fair in 2012, “The rules kept changing. For the first three years, we could say ‘penis.’ Then we couldn’t say ‘penis.’ Then we could say ‘penis’ again.” Added Kauffman: “They’re masturbating on Seinfeld and we can’t show a condom wrapper.” Warren Littlefield, then the president of NBC Entertainment, said he had a lot of battles with broadcast standards. “What could be more socially responsible than these characters practicing safe sex?”"
156,The big white dog actually belonged to Jennifer Aniston.,“Pat the dog” was given to Aniston by a friend for good luck on the first day of shooting Friends.
157,Lisa Kudrow’s pregnancy was written into the show.,"“Here’s what was difficult about having a child: When he visited the set, it was hard to be in character,” Kudrow later said. “Because I didn’t want him to ever experience me as anything OTHER than his mother.”"
158,Cole Sprouse (Ben) had a huge crush on Jennifer Aniston.,"“I had a really, really hard time working with Aniston because I was so in love with her,” he told the New York Post in 2017. “I was infatuated. I was speechless—I’d get all bubbly and forget my lines and completely blank…It was so difficult.”"
159,Matt LeBlanc’s offscreen shoulder injury was written into the episode.,"“Yeah, but get this,” he later told Glamour. “The audience was full of Diet Coke contest winners flown in from all over the country, and I did two scenes, popped my shoulder, and they had to cancel it. So they all got flown home and then flown back for another week. So it cost Coca-Cola a lot more than they anticipated. What are you going to do?”"
160,"Marcel was actually played by two monkeys, Monkey and Katie.","The pair would go on to star in Bruce Almighty, 30 Rock, and other things. In 1995, Schwimmer told Entertainment Weekly that he actually hated the monkey. “The trainers won’t let me bond with it. They’re really, really possessive. It’s like, ‘Land on your marks, do your job, don’t touch or bond with the monkey.’ It's a bummer.” AGREED."
161,Everyone’s last name in the opening for “The One After Vegas” included “Arquette.”,"They were celebrating then-newlyweds Courteney Cox Arquette and David Arquette, who were married from 1999 to 2013."
162,Matthew Perry’s dad made a cameo in season 4.,John Bennett Perry played Joshua’s dad in “The One with Rachel’s New Dress.”
163,"Before he was Frank Jr., Giovanni Ribisi had an uncredited role as ""Condom Boy"" in season 2.","Condom boy, you know, the one who accidentally throws a condom into Phoebe’s guitar case. His days as Frank Jr. were much better."
164,"When Joey and Rachel got together, the cast went to the creators with concerns.","As Matt LeBlanc said in a 2012 Vanity Fair feature, “It felt wildly inappropriate. That’s how close we all were to the character. I was like, ‘That’s Rachel. She was supposed to be with Ross. Wait a minute.’ Everybody got super-defensive about the whole thing.”"
165,Courteney Cox is the only Friend to not receive an Emmy nod for her work on the show.,"Even Christina Pickles, who played Monica’s mom Judy, got a nomination for her guest role one year. Guess the Emmys had no love for Monica’s tidiness, wit, and that incredible “7” scene."
166,Ross is 29 for three years.,"For three consecutive seasons (3, 4, 5), Ross mentions that he’s 29. (In season 5, he actually says he’s getting divorced twice before he’s 30.) Naturally, Ross also has two birthdays on Friends: Oct. 18 and some time in December. Ross can indeed."
167,Cliffhangers were never shot with a live studio audience.,"The season 4 finale, “The One With Ross’s Wedding,"" where Ross says, “I take thee Rachel,” is a prime example. “We couldn’t have an audience for that,” Aniston said in the 2005 Friends: Final Thoughts special. “We always remove the audience for the cliffhangers because, obvious reasons, you don’t want to spoil it.”"
168,Jon Favreau (Pete) originally auditioned for Chandler.,"But don’t worry, Favreau's still got a soft spot for Pete after all these years. “Pete Becker was a man of tremendous focus and conviction. He set his heart to being the Ultimate Fighting Champion and I have no doubt that he gave it his all. I’m only sorry that that chapter was never closed by the Friends writers because I’ll always have to live with the uncertainty of what his fate held.”"
169,"Gunther’s first line came after 33 episodes, when he said, “Yeah.”","Gunther also didn’t have a name until the middle of the second season, and his hair was bleached every week for 10 years because James Michael Tyler’s hair is brown IRL."
170,Janice’s appearances were always kept secret.,"Explains actress Maggie Wheeler, “They would keep me hidden–I could barely come down to get a doughnut. I had to stay in my dressing room until the last moment and then they’d secretly move me from behind the set to the right spot and they’d keep a black screen so the audience couldn’t see me until I made my first entrance.”"
171,“The One With the Halloween Party” was the first episode they filmed after 9/11.,"According to Lisa Kudrow, who says it’s her favorite episode of Friends ever, “That whole week, while driving in L.A., people would pull up and give me a very sad look and a quiet ‘thank you’ for making them laugh.”"
172,Justin Timberlake really wanted a cameo.,"According to show cocreator David Crane, there was a meeting with JT, “but we didn’t have a good part for him.”"
173,Joey and Phoebe could have been a thing.,"In 2016, Matt LeBlanc told EW, “Toward the end, we actually pitched the idea that Joey and Phoebe had been having casual sex the entire time. We’d go back and shoot all the historical scenes and just before a moment that everyone recognizes, there’s Joey and Phoebe coming out of a broom closet together. But they were like, ‘Nah.’”"
174,The espresso machine at Central Perk was never on because it was too loud.,“That was a real antique coffee machine. I never actually made one coffee!” James Michael Tyler (Gunther) later told BuzzFeed.
175,"The finale caused Matt LeBlanc so much anxiety, he started smoking again.","“I had quit smoking for four years, and in that final two weeks, I started smoking again because we were so aware that our time together was coming to an end,” he told Vanity Fair in 2012."
176,"When the series wrapped, each cast member took home a piece of Central Perk.","Specifically, pieces of the fake sidewalk outside Central Perk."
177,Central Perk was torn down to become the airport where Rachel takes off from.,"But as we all know, she got off the plane, which makes the tear-down a waste, no?"
178,Jennifer Aniston almost said no to the final season.,"Speaking to Matt Lauer in 2004, Aniston said she had “a couple issues” with another season. “I wanted it to end when people still loved us and we were on a high. And then I was also feeling like, ‘How much more of Rachel do I have in me?’” She eventually agreed to the final season, just as creators lowered the episode count from 24 to 18."
179,The creators knew early on that Ross and Rachel would end up together.,"“We had dicked the audience around for 10 years with their ‘will they or won’t they,’ and we didn’t see any advantage in frustrating them,” according to David Crane."
180,"Long before Hollywood started tackling the pay gap between male and female actresses, everyone on 'Friends' earned the same per episode.","By the end of the show’s run, each Friend was earning $1 million per episode; today’s pay issues have left Lisa Kudrow “fuming.”"
181,“Shoot nights” could go as late as 1 or 2 a.m.,"If the audience got too tired, they would sometimes be swapped out for a “fresh” one."
182,Rachel was originally supposed to propose to Joshua right after Ross got engaged.,"When Aniston shot that scene after Ross’s engagement, the live audience was so sad that writers decided to move it to the next episode so everyone could have “recovery time.”"
183,Netflix paid $80 million to keep it streaming in 2019.,"After the internet lost its mind when news broke that Friends would leave the streaming service in 2019, Netflix paid a reported $100 million to ensure you can watch the gang 24/7. (It left Netflix for good in January 2020.)"
184,"Originally, the creators wanted Courteney Cox to play Rachel.","In a 2015 interview, Aniston said that while the Friends team wanted Cox to play Rachel, the real-life BFFs had other plans: “Unbeknownst to each other, I wanted to play Rachel and she wanted to play Monica.
